SSP Cloud Presentation

This repository contains the materials for a one-hour online presentation and live demo introducing the [SSP Cloud](https://www.sspcloud.fr/), a public data science platform operated by Insee for the French Statistical System.
The session is organized for members of UMI SOURCE to showcase how SSP Cloud can support training, research, and collaborative work in open and reproducible environments.

Overview

SSP Cloud provides a browser-based environment for data science, offering:
- On-demand computing and storage resources
- Preconfigured and reproducible R/Python environments
- Access to open-source tools only (no proprietary software)
- A secure infrastructure hosted by Insee, independent of commercial providers

It is particularly relevant for:
- Training sessions, where all participants use identical, preconfigured environments
- Research projects requiring scalable computation and shared workflows
- Collaborative work across sites with limited local infrastructure
